            <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But did you know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious story? Follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The First Version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (free vector graphics software) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was just to give a face to the system for his own team‚Äîthere was no official request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: they were called <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A New Mascot Appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot evolved, and the task was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was assigned the mission of creating a more pleasant representation of the little robot.</p>

                <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina">
            </picture>

            <p>Irina‚Äôs main idea was to represent everything graphically with a flat and simple design. The drawing also needed to be easily recognizable at a glance. This is how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot, was born.</p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Android mascot">

            <p>The inspiration for Bugdroid's shape came from the simple stick figures found on restroom signs to indicate gender. Legend has it that Irina was sketching at her desk at Google when she looked at the restroom door and had an instant idea: simple, clean, and direct.</p>

                <p>Another fun fact about Android is that each version was named after a dessert, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0:</p>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Android Q never existed. Google ended this sweet naming tradition and began using version numbers, starting with Android 10.
